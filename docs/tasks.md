# Ollama and OpenWebUI Integration Improvement Tasks

This document contains a checklist of improvement tasks for the Ollama and OpenWebUI integration on Minikube with NVIDIA GPU support. The tasks are organized into categories and are listed in a logical order.

## Documentation Improvements

1. [x] Add a table of contents to the README.md for better navigation
2. [x] Add a section on troubleshooting common issues
3. [x] Add version information for all components (Minikube, kubectl, Helm, etc.)
4. [x] Add a section on how to verify the installation is working correctly
5. [x] Add a section on how to access the deployed services
6. [x] Fix the code block formatting in the README.md (line 45 has four backticks instead of three)
7. [x] Add a section on how to update/upgrade the components
8. [x] Add a section on how to uninstall/clean up the deployment

## Configuration Management

9. [ ] Create a `.env` file template for environment-specific variables
10. [ ] Implement a script to generate configuration files from templates and environment variables
11. [ ] Move hardcoded values (like memory sizes, CPU counts) to configurable variables
12. [ ] Create separate configuration profiles for different environments (development, production)
13. [ ] Add validation for configuration values

## Security Improvements

14. [ ] Implement proper secret management instead of using plain YAML files
15. [ ] Use Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive information
16. [ ] Configure network policies to restrict communication between pods
17. [ ] Add resource quotas and limits for all deployments
18. [ ] Configure proper RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for the services
19. [ ] Implement TLS for all internal communications
20. [ ] Replace the hardcoded ingress host with a configurable value
21. [ ] Add security context configurations for pods

## Automation

22. [x] Create a Makefile or shell script to automate the entire deployment process
23. [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
24. [ ] Add automated health checks for the deployed services
25. [ ] Create scripts for common operations (backup, restore, scaling)
26. [ ] Implement automated monitoring and alerting
27. [ ] Add automated rollback mechanism in case of failed deployments

## Architecture Improvements

28. [ ] Evaluate using Kustomize for managing Kubernetes manifests
29. [ ] Consider implementing a service mesh (like Istio) for better traffic management
30. [ ] Implement horizontal pod autoscaling based on resource usage
31. [ ] Set up proper liveness and readiness probes for all services
32. [ ] Implement a backup solution for persistent volumes
33. [ ] Consider using StatefulSets for stateful components
34. [ ] Evaluate using Operators for managing complex applications

## Performance Optimizations

35. [ ] Fine-tune resource requests and limits based on actual usage
36. [ ] Implement caching mechanisms where appropriate
37. [ ] Optimize persistent volume configurations for better I/O performance
38. [ ] Configure pod anti-affinity for high-availability
39. [ ] Implement proper node affinity for GPU workloads
40. [ ] Evaluate using node taints and tolerations for specialized workloads

## Specific Code Improvements

41. [ ] Replace hardcoded Ollama URL "http://ollama.ollama.svc.cluster.local:11434" with a configurable value
42. [ ] Make the Minikube resource allocation (memory=24576m, cpus=8) configurable
43. [ ] Parameterize the persistent volume sizes in the values files
44. [ ] Add proper labels and annotations to all resources for better management
45. [ ] Implement proper error handling in deployment scripts
46. [ ] Add support for multiple GPU configurations
47. [ ] Create a script to validate the environment before deployment
48. [ ] Implement proper logging configuration for all components
